Updated specifications and enhanced calibration certificates provide additional clarity to uncertainty specifications, helping customers better understand the accuracy and repeatability that products can deliver.\n", "\n", "Most manufacturers of laser power and energy measurement instruments calibrate their product against third party reference standards, such as those from NIST. However, only with independent accreditation can end-users have strong confidence in their measurements.\n", "\n", "This document covers the calibration process, the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025, and the benefits of accreditation.\n", "\n", "## The Calibration Process\n", "\n", "A laser power or energy sensor converts incident light into an electrical signal which is then processed by meter electronics into a reading in the desired units (e.g. Watts or Joules). Each component of a laser measurement system has its own manufacturing tolerances. For example, there are unit-to-unit variations in the coatings applied to detectors, in the bulk material of the detectors themselves, and in the electronic characteristics of components used to construct the meter. As a result, two different measuring systems, as originally built, may not produce identical readings when exposed to exactly the same light input.\n", "\n", "Manufacturers minimize this unit-to-unit variation through a process of calibration. Specifically, calibration refers to an unbroken and traceable series of comparisons to a widely agreed upon reference standard that is typically maintained by a national laboratory or international standards body.\n", "\n", "### Traceability of Sensors\n", "\n", "For optical laser power and energy measurements, the calibration process starts when an instrument builder sends a dedicated \u201cgolden\u201d sensor to a standards organization, which then exposes the sensor to a series of known power and/or energy inputs (depending upon the sensor type), recording the output for each case. In this way, the sensor has its performance confirmed in the form of Volts of electrical output per Watt or Joule of optical input. This ratio of output to input is known as the responsivity of the sensor, and is typically labeled as R<sub>\u03bb</sub>. This sensor then becomes a \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d against which all other sensors can be measured.\n", "\n", "Once the \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d is returned to the manufacturer and other sensors are measured against it, accurate and traceable responsivity measurements can be put into place. These results can be recorded or stored for use in calculating the power or energy when the sensor is delivered to a customer and used in a measurement system. In practice, a standards body, such as NIST, can only certify a small number of sensors for a given manufacturer each year. So, companies such as Coherent, that produce laser measurement systems in high volume, normally maintain a number of \u201cworking standards\u201d within their organizations, each calibrated against the \u201cgolden standard.\u201d Production units are then, in turn, calibrated against the working standards and enough working standards are maintained to meet all production testing needs.\n", "\n", "### Traceability of Meters\n", "\n", "Coherent energy or power meter electronics are traceable to a national standard by calibrating them against NIST-traceable current or voltage standards. Internal electronics in the meter can be adjusted to ensure that it is sensing voltage correctly. That is, if it is given a 1V input, that it \u201csees\u201d this as 1V, and then correctly converts this voltage into laser power or energy.\n", "\n", "================================================================================\n", "Document 2 of 5:\n", "================================================================================\n", "\n", "## Calibration Process Summary\n", "\n", "This type of arrangement provides a clear path of traceability from production units to the national standard; production units are calibrated to working standards, working standards are calibrated to golden standards, and golden standards are calibrated to national standards.\n", "\n", "While every major supplier engages in a traceable calibration process, there are significant differences in the details of how this is accomplished. In particular, there are variations in the statistical methods used to define uncertainty, and in the exact protocols that each manufacturer maintains with respect to establishing and maintaining laboratory methods. To understand the reliance that can be placed on a reading from a laser measurement system, it is necessary - and appropriate - to ask instrument manufacturers about their precise calibration methods, the meaning of their specifications and, in some circumstances, it may be even necessary to audit a supplier\u2019s facility and processes.\n", "\n", "## Understanding Calibration Uncertainty\n", "\n", "The primary parameter used to specify calibration capability is uncertainty. Calibration uncertainty defines how far away readings from a given instrument should be to the actual, true value of the parameter being measured. This uncertainty takes into account the combined uncertainties from all stages of the calibration process, from variations in the golden standard itself, all the way through to the unit under test.\n", "\n", "### Components of Uncertainty\n", "\n", "If a large number of identical measurements are made with a single instrument, the values obtained will have a distribution representing the instrument\u2019s repeatability. If these same measurements are made with several instruments, then these measurements will also vary slightly from instrument to instrument reflecting slight variations in the calibration process. Even the calibration of the \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d will also have some uncertainty associated with it. All of these contributions are combined to produce an overall calibration uncertainty of the final instrument. Repeated measurements made with multiple instruments will typically adhere to a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n", "\n", "### Confidence Interval and Coverage Factor\n", "\n", "The calibration uncertainty for laser power and energy measurement instruments is commonly in the range of 1% to 5%. The assumption could be made that every reading taken with an instrument will be within that accuracy range. For example, if a laser power meter product that has a 1% calibration uncertainty takes numerous measurements of a continuous wave laser beam having a true power of exactly 1 Watt, then one might think that all the readings will be between 0.99 Watts and 1.01 Watts. However, this is not the case.\n", "\n", "The way that calibration uncertainty is defined by manufacturers is not intended to include all values within this distribution. Rather, it includes values that occur within a set number of standard deviations from the mean. Unless this number of standard deviations, representing the \u201cconfidence interval,\u201d is explicitly stated, the value for calibration uncertainty cannot be interpreted and becomes essentially meaningless. Coherent uncertainty specifications are based upon a confidence interval of 95%, equal to two standard deviations, otherwise known as a \u201ck=2\u201d coverage factor.\n", "\n", "### In Depth: Uncertainty Coverage Factor\n", "\n", "For a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the readings will have a value that is within one standard deviation (\u00b11\u03c3) of the mean value. Going out to two standard deviations (\u00b12\u03c3) encompasses 95% of all readings.\n", "\n", "| Deviation | Percentage of Readings |\n", "|-----------|------------------------|\n", "| \u00b11\u03c3       | 68%                    |\n", "| \u00b12\u03c3       | 95%                    |\n", "\n", "For example, when using a power meter with a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11%, and a confidence interval of 1 (usually denoted k=1), nearly one third (about 32 of 100) of the readings would be expected to be greater than 1% different from the true value. In contrast, a power meter with a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11% and k=2 would deliver readings that have an absolute accuracy of better than 1% in 95 out of 100 measurements.\n", "\n", "Obviously, there is a big difference between these two situations, despite the fact that each one can reasonably be said to represent a system displaying a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11%. Unfortunately, confidence interval is often not stated explicitly, and it is up to the buyer to question potential suppliers as to the precise meaning of their published specifications for calibration uncertainty.\n", "\n", "================================================================================\n", "Document 3 of 5:\n", "================================================================================\n", "\n", "# ISO/IEC 17025 Fundamentals\n", "\n", "ISO 17025 accreditation requires adherence to guidelines for a variety of policies and processes, not just covering a calibration organization\u2019s metrology methods and procedures, but also its management system. It represents a substantially more exacting series of requirements than those necessary in the more general ISO 9001 standard.\n", "\n", "## Accreditation\n", "\n", "Accreditation can only be accomplished by having a compliant Management System as well as demonstrating competency and proficiency to a third party auditor. Coherent has selected ACLASS, one of three brands of the ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board, as its third party ISO 17025 auditor.\n", "\n", "ACLASS is a signatory to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), the international body which helps standardize and recognize accreditation systems worldwide and publishes guidance documents to support these efforts. Accreditation bodies around the world typically pursue ILAC recognition through one of the acknowledged regional cooperations of ILAC.

Non-accredited \u201ccompliance\u201d with ISO 17025 can really mean whatever a particular company wants it to mean, so again, it is necessary to question manufacturers as to the specifics of their methods. For example, a company may state that their calibration certificates are compliant with ISO 17025, but this may just mean that test parameters are listed on the calibration certificate in a format that is consistent with ISO 17025 requirements. However, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the procedures and instrumentation used to obtain these numbers are ISO 17025 compliant.

Thus, there is a formal accreditation trail that documents all the procedures utilized by Coherent for performing calibration, and which independently ensures that proper methods and processes have been put into place and are being maintained.\n", "\n", "Other suppliers may claim that various aspects of their process or reporting are ISO 17025 \u201ccompliant,\u201d but this claim really tells the instrument buyer very little about the actual procedures they use internally, or the true uncertainty of measurements made with their products.

Updated specifications and enhanced calibration certificates provide additional clarity to uncertainty specifications, helping customers better understand the accuracy and repeatability that products can deliver.\n", "\n", "Most manufacturers of laser power and energy measurement instruments calibrate their product against third party reference standards, such as those from NIST. However, only with independent accreditation can end-users have strong confidence in their measurements.\n", "\n", "This document covers the calibration process, the requirements of ISO/IEC 17025, and the benefits of accreditation.\n", "\n", "## The Calibration Process\n", "\n", "A laser power or energy sensor converts incident light into an electrical signal which is then processed by meter electronics into a reading in the desired units (e.g. Watts or Joules). Each component of a laser measurement system has its own manufacturing tolerances. For example, there are unit-to-unit variations in the coatings applied to detectors, in the bulk material of the detectors themselves, and in the electronic characteristics of components used to construct the meter. As a result, two different measuring systems, as originally built, may not produce identical readings when exposed to exactly the same light input.\n", "\n", "Manufacturers minimize this unit-to-unit variation through a process of calibration. Specifically, calibration refers to an unbroken and traceable series of comparisons to a widely agreed upon reference standard that is typically maintained by a national laboratory or international standards body.\n", "\n", "### Traceability of Sensors\n", "\n", "For optical laser power and energy measurements, the calibration process starts when an instrument builder sends a dedicated \u201cgolden\u201d sensor to a standards organization, which then exposes the sensor to a series of known power and/or energy inputs (depending upon the sensor type), recording the output for each case. In this way, the sensor has its performance confirmed in the form of Volts of electrical output per Watt or Joule of optical input. This ratio of output to input is known as the responsivity of the sensor, and is typically labeled as R<sub>\u03bb</sub>. This sensor then becomes a \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d against which all other sensors can be measured.\n", "\n", "Once the \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d is returned to the manufacturer and other sensors are measured against it, accurate and traceable responsivity measurements can be put into place. These results can be recorded or stored for use in calculating the power or energy when the sensor is delivered to a customer and used in a measurement system. In practice, a standards body, such as NIST, can only certify a small number of sensors for a given manufacturer each year. So, companies such as Coherent, that produce laser measurement systems in high volume, normally maintain a number of \u201cworking standards\u201d within their organizations, each calibrated against the \u201cgolden standard.\u201d Production units are then, in turn, calibrated against the working standards and enough working standards are maintained to meet all production testing needs.\n", "\n", "### Traceability of Meters\n", "\n", "Coherent energy or power meter electronics are traceable to a national standard by calibrating them against NIST-traceable current or voltage standards. Internal electronics in the meter can be adjusted to ensure that it is sensing voltage correctly. That is, if it is given a 1V input, that it \u201csees\u201d this as 1V, and then correctly converts this voltage into laser power or energy.\n", "\n", "----\n", "\n", "www.Coherent.com | LMC.sales@coherent.com | (800) 343-4912 | (408) 764-4042\n", "\n", "================================================================================\n", "Document 2 of 5:\n", "================================================================================\n", "\n", "# Calibration Process Summary\n", "\n", "This type of arrangement provides a clear path of traceability from production units to the national standard; production units are calibrated to working standards, working standards are calibrated to golden standards, and golden standards are calibrated to national standards.\n", "\n", "While every major supplier engages in a traceable calibration process, there are significant differences in the details of how this is accomplished. In particular, there are variations in the statistical methods used to define uncertainty, and in the exact protocols that each manufacturer maintains with respect to establishing and maintaining laboratory methods. To understand the reliance that can be placed on a reading from a laser measurement system, it is necessary - and appropriate - to ask instrument manufacturers about their precise calibration methods, the meaning of their specifications and, in some circumstances, it may be even necessary to audit a supplier\u2019s facility and processes.\n", "\n", "# Understanding Calibration Uncertainty\n", "\n", "The primary parameter used to specify calibration capability is uncertainty. Calibration uncertainty defines how far away readings from a given instrument should be to the actual, true value of the parameter being measured. This uncertainty takes into account the combined uncertainties from all stages of the calibration process, from variations in the golden standard itself, all the way through to the unit under test.\n", "\n", "## Components of Uncertainty\n", "\n", "If a large number of identical measurements are made with a single instrument, the values obtained will have a distribution representing the instrument\u2019s repeatability. If these same measurements are made with several instruments, then these measurements will also vary slightly from instrument to instrument reflecting slight variations in the calibration process. Even the calibration of the \u201cgolden standard sensor\u201d will also have some uncertainty associated with it. All of these contributions are combined to produce an overall calibration uncertainty of the final instrument. Repeated measurements made with multiple instruments will typically adhere to a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n", "\n", "## Confidence Interval and Coverage Factor\n", "\n", "The calibration uncertainty for laser power and energy measurement instruments is commonly in the range of 1% to 5%. The assumption could be made that every reading taken with an instrument will be within that accuracy range. For example, if a laser power meter product that has a 1% calibration uncertainty takes numerous measurements of a continuous wave laser beam having a true power of exactly 1 Watt, then one might think that all the readings will be between 0.99 Watts and 1.01 Watts. However, this is not the case.\n", "\n", "The way that calibration uncertainty is defined by manufacturers is not intended to include all values within this distribution. Rather, it includes values that occur within a set number of standard deviations from the mean. Unless this number of standard deviations, representing the \u201cconfidence interval,\u201d is explicitly stated, the value for calibration uncertainty cannot be interpreted and becomes essentially meaningless. Coherent uncertainty specifications are based upon a confidence interval of 95%, equal to two standard deviations, otherwise known as a \u201ck=2\u201d coverage factor.\n", "\n", "## In Depth: Uncertainty Coverage Factor\n", "\n", "For a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the readings will have a value that is within one standard deviation (\u00b11\u03c3) of the mean value. Going out to two standard deviations (\u00b12\u03c3) encompasses 95% of all readings.\n", "\n", "| Deviation | Percentage of Readings |\n", "|-----------|------------------------|\n", "| \u00b11\u03c3       | 68%                    |\n", "| \u00b12\u03c3       | 95%                    |\n", "\n", "For example, when using a power meter with a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11%, and a confidence interval of 1 (usually denoted k=1), nearly one third (about 32 of 100) of the readings would be expected to be greater than 1% different from the true value. In contrast, a power meter with a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11% and k=2 would deliver readings that have an absolute accuracy of better than 1% in 95 out of 100 measurements.\n", "\n", "Obviously, there is a big difference between these two situations, despite the fact that each one can reasonably be said to represent a system displaying a calibration uncertainty of \u00b11%. Unfortunately, confidence interval is often not stated explicitly, and it is up to the buyer to question potential suppliers as to the precise meaning of their published specifications for calibration uncertainty.\n", "\n", "www.Coherent.com | LMC.sales@coherent.com | (800) 343-4912 | (408) 764-4042\n", "\n", "================================================================================\n", "Document 3 of 5:\n", "================================================================================\n", "\n", "# ISO/IEC 17025 Fundamentals\n", "\n", "ISO 17025 accreditation requires adherence to guidelines for a variety of policies and processes, not just covering a calibration organization\u2019s metrology methods and procedures, but also its management system.

Non-accredited \u201ccompliance\u201d with ISO 17025 can really mean whatever a particular company wants it to mean, so again, it is necessary to question manufacturers as to the specifics of their methods. For example, a company may state that their calibration certificates are compliant with ISO 17025, but this may just mean that test parameters are listed on the calibration certificate in a format that is consistent with ISO 17025 requirements.

Dear XXX

Thank you for the information you sent us. As we are starting the study for integration of Coherent laser source into our new UV laser Marker we need some other technical information.
To improve the communication efficiency I present you the team that is working on this project:

YYY: Systems Engineer for this project.
YYY: R&D Buyer for this project.
YYY: Program Manager for this project

Please keep me and the three contacts above in CC for all communications. Other team
Other team members and some of their preliminary questions. They will ask you directly any other technical questions they may have:
YYY: Laser/Optical Engineer. Request for some optical tolerance analysis:
Can you please share the output laser beam specs and tolerances, namely:
Beam diameter (Typ, Min and Max)
Beam divergence (Typ and Max)
Beam offset with respect to optical output center (Min and Max)
Beam pointing with respect to optical output center axis (Typ, Max)
Beam M2 (Typ and Max)

YYY: Mechanical Engineer. Requests for preliminary integration study and tolerance analysis:
Can you please share the 2D drawings of the laser dimensions, mounting fixtures and respective tolerances, as well as a 3D step file.
Can you please share the 2D drawings of the optional dissipater dimensions, mounting fixtures and tolerances, as well as a 3D step file.
Can you please share the 2D drawings of the optional mounting plate dimensions, mounting fixtures and tolerances, as well as a 3D step file
Can you please share the maximum heat to dissipate from the laser source
Can you please let us know the maximum volume of air flow to allow proper colling for the laser (m3/min)

YYY: HW Engineer. Non additional request at this time

YYY; FPGA Engineer. Ask for some additional detail on the control of the laser power/energy on Powertrack mode. Maybe providing some timing diagram examples.
The system requires some time to sample the input signal to determine the frequency or will emit a pulse on demand for each input impulse?
What should be the proper setting of the impulse signal for having:
One train of impulses at 100KHz and power at 50%, followed by another train of impulses at 50KHz at 50% of power. Any restriction or limitation of the time (OFF) between the two trains?
How would be the above signal for a frequency of first train of 20kHz and the second at 10kHz?

YYY: FW Engineer. No additional request at this time
YYY: SW Engineer. No additional request at this time.

Best regards

YYY

PS: Team, please send your questions directly to XXX keeping the CC rule above.

Thank you XXX

We will analyze the data you kindly sent us and get back to you asap.

Best regards

YYY

Dear YYY,

Regarding item 8: Time between interlock / no emission:
We measured the time between the interlock circuit being opened (CH2, blue) and the laser diode current (CH1, yellow) dropping to below 1A. We measured the interval to ca. 1ms. Please see the attached oscilloscope measurement data.

Best regards,
XXX
